<h3 class='c008'><span class='fss'>A.M.</span> <br /> 7</h3>

<p class='c009'>Woke up feeling rather below par, owing to
disturbed rest. Hardly enough energy to stretch myself.
In the middle of the night a strange man came in by the
kitchen window, very quietly, with a bag. I chummed up
to him at once. He was nice to me, and I was nice to
him. He got me down a piece of meat that I could not
reach myself. While I was engaged on this, he took a
whole lot of silver things and put them into the bag.
Then, as he was leaving, the brute—I believe, now, it
was an accident—trod on my toe, making me yelp with
pain. I bit him heartily, and he dropped his bag, and
scurried off through the window again. My yelping
soon woke up the whole house, and, in a very short time,
old Mr. Brown and young Mr. Brown appear. They
at once spot the bag of silver. They then declare I have
saved the house, and make no end of fuss with me. I
am a hero. Later on Miss Brown came down and
fondled me lots, and kissed me, and tied a piece of pink
ribbon round my neck, and made me look a fool. What’s
the good of ribbon, I should like to know? It’s the most
beastly tasting stuff there ever was.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image007.jpg' alt='dog wearing ribbon' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>8:30.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Ate breakfast with difficulty. Have no appetite.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>8:35.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Ate kittens’ breakfast.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>8:36.</h3>

<p class='c009'>An affair with the cat (the kittens’ mother). But
I soon leave her, as the coward does not fight fair, using
claws.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image009.jpg' alt='dog eating' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>9:0.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Washed by Mary.
A hateful business. Put into a tub, and rubbed all over—mouth,
tail, and everywhere—with filthy soapy water,
that loathsome cat looking on all the while, and sneering in
her dashed superior way. I don’t know, I am sure, why
the hussy should be so conceited. She has to clean herself.
I keep a servant to clean me. At the same time I
often wish I was a black dog. They keep clean so
much longer. Every finger-mark shows up so frightfully
on the white part of me. I am a sight after Cook has
been stroking me.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>9:30.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Showed myself in my washed state to the family.
All very nice to me. Quite a triumphal entry, in fact. It
is simply wonderful the amount of kudos I’ve got from
that incident with the man. Miss Brown (whom I
rather like) particularly enthusiastic. Kissed me again
and again, and called me “a dear, clean, brave, sweet-smelling
little doggie.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image011.jpg' alt='dog being washed' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>9:40.</h3>

<p class='c009'>While a visitor was being let in at the front-door I
rushed out, and had the most glorious roll in the mud.
Felt more like my old self then.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>9:45.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Visited the family again. Shrieks of horror on seeing
me caked in mud. But all agreed that I was not to be
scolded to-day as I was a hero (over the man!). All,
that is, except Aunt Brown, whose hand, for some reason
or other, is always against me—though nothing is too
good for the cat. She stigmatised me, quite gratuitously,
as “a horrid fellow.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image013.jpg' alt='glorious roll in mud' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>9:50.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Glorious thought! Rushed upstairs and rolled over
and over on the old maid’s bed. Thank Heaven, the
mud was still wet!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image015.jpg' alt='dog rolling on bed' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>10 to 10:15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Wagged tail.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image017.jpg' alt='dog wagging tail' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>10:16.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Down into kitchen. While Cook is watching regiment
pass, I play with chops, and bite big bits out of
them. Cook, who is quite upset for the day by seeing so
many soldiers, continues to cook the chops without
noticing.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>10:20 to ...</h3>

<p class='c009'>Dozed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image019.jpg' alt='dog eating' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>1:15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Ate kittens’ dinner.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image021.jpg' alt='dog eating' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>1:20.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Attacked by beast of cat again. She scratched my
hind-leg, and at that I refused to go on. Mem.: to take
it out of her kittens later.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image023.jpg' alt='dog scratched by cat' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>1:25.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Upstairs into dining-room. Family not finished lunch
yet. Young Mr. Brown throws a bread pellet at me,
hitting me on the nozzle. An insult. I swallow the
insult. Then I go up to Miss Brown and look at her
with my great pleading eyes. I guessed it: they are
irresistible. She gives me a piece of pudding. Aunt
Brown tells her she shouldn’t. At which, with great
pluck, Miss Brown tells her to mind her own business.
I admire that girl more and more.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image025.jpg' alt='dog being fed' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>1:30.</h3>

<p class='c009'>A windfall. A whole dish of mayonnaise fish on the
slab in the hall. Before you can say Jack Robinson I
have bolted it.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1:32.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Curious pains in my underneath.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image027.jpg' alt='dog dozing' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>1:33.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Pains in my underneath get worse.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1:34.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Horrid feeling of sickness.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image029.jpg' alt='dog looking sick' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>1:35.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Rush up into Aunt Brown’s room, and am sick there.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image031.jpg' alt='dog sick under bed' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>1:37.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Better. Think I shall pull through if I am careful.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1:40.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Almost well again.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1:41.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Quite well again. Thank Heavens! It was a
narrow shave that time. People ought not to leave such
stuff about.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1:42.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Up into dining-room. And, to show how well I am,
I gallumph round and round the room, at full pelt, about
twenty times, steering myself by my tail. Then, as a grand
finale, I jump twice on to the waistcoat-part of old Mr.
Brown, who is sleeping peacefully in the arm-chair. He
wakes up very angry indeed, and uses words I have never
heard before. Even Miss Brown, to my no little surprise,
says it is very naughty of me. Old Mr. Brown insists on
my being punished, and orders Miss Brown to beat me.
Miss Brown runs the burglar for all he is worth. But
no good. Old Mr. Brown is dead to all decent feeling!</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image033.jpg' alt='dog jumping on man' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>So Miss Brown beats me. Very nice. Thoroughly enjoyable.
Just like being patted. But, of course, I yelp,
and pretend it hurts frightfully, and do the sad-eye
business, and she soon leaves off and takes me into the
next room and gives me six pieces of sugar! Good
business. Must remember always to do this. Before
leaving she kisses me and explains that I should not have
jumped on poor Pa, as he is the man who goes to the
City to earn bones for me. Something in that, perhaps.
Nice girl.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image035.jpg' alt='dog being hugged' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>2:0 to 3:15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Attempt to kill fur rug in back room. No good.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>3:15 to 3:45.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Sulked.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>3:46.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Small boy comes in, and strokes me. I snap at him.
<em>I will not</em> be every one’s plaything.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image037.jpg' alt='dog chewing rug' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>3:47 to 4:0.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Another attempt to kill rug. Would have done it this
time, had not that odious Aunt Brown come in and
interfered. I did not say anything, but gave her such a
look, as much as to say, “I’ll do for you one day.” I
think she understood.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>4:0 to 5:15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Slept.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image039.jpg' alt='dog pulled off rug' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>5:15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Awakened by bad attack of eczema.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image041.jpg' alt='dog scratching' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>5:20 to 5:30.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Slept again.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>5:30.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Awakened again by eczema. Caught one.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image043.jpg' alt='dog scratching' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>5:30 to 6:0.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Frightened canary by staring greedily at it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image045.jpg' alt='dog watching bird' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>6:0.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Visited kitchen-folk. Boned some bones.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image047.jpg' alt='dog carrying bone' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>6:15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Stalked a kitten in kitchen-passage. The other
little cowards ran away.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>6:20.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Things are looking brighter: helped mouse escape
from cat.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image049.jpg' alt='dog helping mouse' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>6:30.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Upstairs, past the drawing-room. Door of old Mrs.
Brown’s bedroom open invitingly. I entered. Never
been in before. Nothing much worth having. Ate a few
flowers out of a bonnet. Beastly.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image051.jpg' alt='dog eating flowers' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then into Miss Brown’s room. Very tidy when I
entered. Discovered there packet labelled “High-class
Pure Confectionery.” Not bad. Pretty room.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image053.jpg' alt='dog eating confectionery' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>7:0.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Down to supper. Ate it, but without much relish.
I am off my feed to-day.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>7:15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Ate kittens’ supper. But I do wish they would not
give them that eternal fish. I am getting sick of it.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>7:16.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Sick of it in the garden.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>7:25.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Nasty feeling of lassitude comes over me, with loss of
all initiative, so I decide to take things quietly, and lie
down by the kitchen fire. Sometimes I think that I am
not the dog that I was.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>8:0.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Hooray! Appetite returning.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>8:1.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Ravenous.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>8:2.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Have one of the nicest pieces of coal I have
ever come across.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image055.jpg' alt='dog eating coal' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>8:5.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Nose around the kitchen floor, and glean a bit of
onion, an imitation tortoise-shell comb, a shrimp (almost
entire), an abominably stale chunk of bread, and about
half a yard of capital string. After coal, I think I like
string best. The family have noticed what a lot of this I
stow away, and it was not a bad idea of young Mr.
Brown’s, the other day, that, if I had the end of a piece
of string always hanging from my mouth, they could use
me as a string-box. Though it is scarcely a matter for
joking about. Still, it made me laugh.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>8:30.</h3>

<p class='c009'>If one had to rely on other people one might
starve. Fortunately, in the hall I happen on the treacle-pudding,
and I get first look in. Lap up the treacle, and
leave the suet for the family. A1.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image057.jpg' alt='dog eating treacle' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>8:40.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Down into the kitchen again. Sit by the fire,
and pretend I don’t know what treacle is like. But that
vile cat is there, and I believe she guesses—keeps looking
round at me with her hateful superior look. Dash her,
what right has she got to give herself such airs? She’s
not half my size, and pays no taxes. Dash her smugness.
Dash her altogether. The sight of her maddens me—and,
when her back is turned, I rush at her, and bite her.
The crafty coward wags her tail, pretending she likes it,
so I do it again, and then she rounds on me, and scratches
my paw viciously, drawing blood, and making me howl
with pain. This brings Miss Brown down in a hurry.
She kisses me, tells the cat she is a naughty cat (<em>I’d</em> have
killed her for it), gives me some sugar, and wraps the
paw up in a bread-poultice. Lord, how that girl loves me!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>9:0.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Ate the bread-poultice.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>9:15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Begin to get sleepy.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>9:15 to 10:0.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Dozed.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>10:0.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Led to kennel.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>10:15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Lights out. Thus ends another dernd dull day.</p>
